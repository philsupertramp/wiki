Since my early teenage years\nI was interested in tech and programming, but spent most of my time playing several MMORPGs like Diablo 2\nand World of Warcraft.\nA few years ago I moved out of my parents place and started studying mathematics in one of the most distant places\nin Germany. During the first years I always told myself to not get to comfortable living here since </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's only for a few years and I'm gonna go back home anyways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/1X8TXeLwY2ojkQgrOo/giphy.gif\" style=\"width: 90%; margin-left: 5%\"></div>\n<p>So I <strong>started</strong> working on several private projects</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a smart home platform to connect all your devices with a local raspberry pi so you can control all your devices through a web interface</li>\n<li>a social web app (tinder like) where you can swipe for a lunch partner to socialize and explore different restaurants</li>\n<li>a time management tool to track working times, with scheduling and team management</li>\n<li>\n<p>a ml image detection service to detect the species a specific kind of plant</p>\n<ul>\n<li>including a website to categorize images</li>\n<li>a coin system to exchange image classifications with manual classified images</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>out of those ideas none ever made it into production.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-problem\" aria-label=\"the problem permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The problem</h2>\n<p>I love starting but it's way too hard to finish.</p>\n<p><em>But why is that so?</em></p>\n<p>For me the main reason is perfectionism.
